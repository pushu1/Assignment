    <h2>1) What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to a Vast Open Source Community of Resources. There is a vast community of open-source developers who
            contribute regularly to Bootstrap. ...</li>
        <li>Consistent Designs.</li>
        <li>Access to Support.</li>
        <li>Fast Development.</li>
        <li>Responsive Business Actions with a Grid System.</li>
        <li>Customizable Expansion.</li>
        <li>Loaded JavaScript Components.</li>
        <li>Easy to Integrate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2) What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
        Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be
        nested, most layouts do not require a nested container</p>
    <p>Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container</li>
        <li>The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>3) What are the default Bootstrap text settings?</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is
    <ol>
        <li>Helvetica Neue</li>
        <li>sans-serif</li>
        <li>Helvetica</li>
        <li>Arial</li>
    </ol>
    In addition, all
    (p Tag) elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>
    <h2>4) What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. It's built
        with flexbox and is fully responsive. </p>
    <h3>Grid Classes</h3>
    <h4>The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)</li>
        <li>sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)</li>
        <li>md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)</li>
        <li>lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Grid System Rules</h3>
    <h4>Some Bootstrap grid system rules:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment
            and padding</li>
        <li>Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns</li>
        <li>Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows</li>
        <li>Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts</li>
        <li>Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the
            first and last column via negative margin on .rows</li>
        <li>Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example,
            three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4</li>
        <li>Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6) What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?</h2>
