    <h2> 1) What is JavaScript. How to use it? </h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages —
        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
        displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
    </p>
    <h2> 2) How many type of Variable in JavaScript? </h2>
    <p>There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.</p>
    <h2> 3) Define a Data Types in js?</h2>
    <p>Data types describe the different types or kinds of data that we're gonna be working with and storing in
        variables. In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data
        are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.</p>
    <h2>5) What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
    <h4>Undeclared</h4>
    <p>When a variable is “undeclared,” it means that it has not been declared or defined in the current scope. In other
        words, it hasn’t been given a value or a type. This can happen if you try to use a variable without declaring it
        first, or if you misspell the variable name.</p>
    <h4>Undefined</h4>
    <p>Unlike “undeclared” variables, “undefined” variables have been declared in the current scope, but have not been
        given a value. In other words, they have been initialized, but their value is not defined.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>10) What is Condition Statement?</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the
        condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of
        action that satisfies that particular condition.

        There are several methods that can be used to perform Conditional Statements in JavaScript.
    <ul>
        <li>if Statement</li>
        <li>if-else Statement</li>
        <li>else if Statement</li>
        <li>switch Statement</li>
        <li>Ternary Operator</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>15) What is the result of the expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4)?</h2>
            <p>The result is true, because at least one of the conditions is true.</p>
            <h2>16) What is the result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello")? </h2>
            <p>The result is "hello", because all the operands are truthy, and the "&&" operator returns the last truthy
                operand.</p>
            <h2>17) What is the result of the expression true && false || false && true? </h2>
            <p>The result is false, because the "&&" operator has higher precedence than the "||" operator, so the
                expression is equivalent to ((true && false) || (false && true)), which returns false.</p>
            <h2>18) What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ? </h2>
            <p>A for loop is a control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code a certain number of times,
                while a switch case is a control structure that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on
                the value of an expression.</p>
            <h2>19) What is the use of is Nan function?</h2>
            <p>isNaN() method returns true if a value is Not-a-Number. Number.isNaN() returns true if a number is
                Not-a-Number. In other words: isNaN() converts the value to a number before testing it.</p>
            <h2>20) What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>Difference between && and || and their opposites
                || means “or”. It evaluates to true if the expression on either side is truthy. && means “and”.</p>
            <h2>21) What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term
                “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused
                while inserting an expression in a web page.</p>
            <h2>50) What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?</h2>
            <p>1. Memory Inefficiency:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each instance of the object will have its own copy of the methods, even if they are identical.</li>
                <li>This can lead to increased memory usage, especially when dealing with many instances of similar objects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2. Performance Overhead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating new method copies for each object instance takes time and resources.</li>
                <li>This can impact performance, particularly in applications with frequent object creation and method calls.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>3. Lack of Inheritance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Methods declared directly within objects are not shared through inheritance.</li>
                <li>This means each object must redefine its own methods, even those that are common across multiple objects.</li>
                <li>Prototype-based inheritance, on the other hand, allows sharing methods efficiently among related objects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>4. Potential for Naming Conflicts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If multiple objects with the same method names are combined, their methods might overwrite each other, leading to unexpected behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>5. Issues with this Keyword:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a method is called directly within an object, this refers to the global object, not the object itself.</li>
                <li>This can lead to errors and unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>when to use object:</h3>
                <p>Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a
                    book, a
                    character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of
                    characteristics. In
                    objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.</p>
                <h4>Syntax:</h4>
                <p>// Basic object syntax <br>
                    var object = { <br>
                    key: 'value' <br>
                    }; <br>
                    Example 'person' object <br>

                <h1>Array</h1>
                <h3>when to use array:</h3>
                <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable.
                    Arrays are
                    especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by
                    their
                    numerical position in the list. Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data
                    type (as
                    well as an array or another object), so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans,
                    objects, or
                    even other arrays.</p>

                <li>What is JavaScript?</li>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on

                    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third
                    layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in
                    much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
                <li>What is the use of isNaN function?</li>
                <p>isNaN() returns true if a number is Not-a-Number. In other words: isNaN() converts the value to a
                    number before testing it.</p>
                <li>What is negative Infinity?</li>
                <p>NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or
                    mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in
                    JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY
                    value as -Infinity .</p>
                <li>Which company developed JavaScript?</li>
                <p>JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed
                    JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape
                    Navigator.</p>
                <li>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</li>
                <p>Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined
                    is not a keyword. </p>
                <p>Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier
                    using the var or const keyword. If we use ‘typeof’ operator to get the value of an undeclared
                    variable, we will face the runtime error with the return value as “undefined”. The scope of the
                    undeclared variables is always global</p>

                <li>What is === operator?</li>
                <p>The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean
                    result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of
                    different types to be different.</p>
                <li>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</li>
                <p>The document. getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document with the “id”

                </p>
                <p>3) file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.5</p>
                <li>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</li>
                <p>1) for/in - loops through the properties of an object.</p>
                <p>2) for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.</p>
                <p>3) while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</p>
                <p>4) do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</p>
                <li>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</li>
                <p>Using parseInt() Method - The parseInt() method accepts the string and radix parameter and converts
                    it into an integer.</p>
                <li>What is the function of the delete operator?</li>
                <p>In JavaScript, the delete operator is the only way to remove properties from an object. When you use
                    delete, it'll return true when it removes a property and false otherwise. The delete operator
                    shouldn't be used on predefined JavaScript object properties.</p>

                <li>What is the use of Void (0)?</li>
                <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the
                    term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects
                    caused while inserting an expression in a web page.</p>
                <li>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</li>
                <p>We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in
                    Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the
                    document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it</p>
                <li>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</li>
                <p>It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content
                    again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are
                    not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.</p>
